3. **Projects** - Showcase of work with details and links
4. **Skills** - Technical expertise categorized by domain
5. **Experience** - Professional work history
6. **Education** - Academic background
7. **Contact** - Contact form and information

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React with TypeScript

- Type safety ensured with TypeScript interfaces
- Easy to update and maintain

### Animation System
- Custom hooks for reusable animations
- GSAP ScrollTrigger for scroll-based animations
- Optimized for performance

### Navigation
- Smooth scrolling to sections
- Active section highlighting
- Mobile-responsive navigation menu

### Contact Form
- Form validation
- Success/error handling
- Animated feedback

## Deployment

The site is deployed to GitHub Pages using the following workflow:

1. Build process with `npm run build`
2. Deployment with `npm run deploy` (using gh-pages package)
3. Automated CI/CD via GitHub Actions

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:

1. Dark/light theme toggle
2. Internationalization support
3. Blog section
4. Advanced 3D interactions
5. Backend integration for the contact form
6. More interactive project demos
7. Advanced animations and transitions

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **3D background performance**: Adjust particle count in ThreeBackground.tsx
2. **Animation stuttering**: Check for conflicting animations or reduce complexity
3. **Mobile responsiveness**: Test on various device sizes and adjust breakpoints
